<p class="message">
My name is Erik, sometimes called Skip.  

I am a San Francisco native, and an avid enthusiast for entreprenurship, the tech startup space, and learning new things at every possible opportunity.  

When I'm not working on data science projects, I am either playing music, or somewhere in the outdoors biking, hiking, skiing or taking part in some other nature-centric activity.  

I will be using this blog to chronicle my projects in data science, and to share anything inspiring I come across along the way.
