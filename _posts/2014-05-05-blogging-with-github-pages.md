_Note: As of 6/2/2014, this post is still a work in progress_


My new blog is built with [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) using [Poole's](http://getpoole.com/) [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com/) template and the [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) discussion system.

This article is the first post, and in it I describe how I went from zero to a nice developer web site.

# Notes

```bash
jeckyll serve -w # serve the blog locally # http://localhost:4000
```
